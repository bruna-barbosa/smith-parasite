## The Smith Parasite - Group 19

The  goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question,  “Who  are  the  people  more  likely  to  suffer  from  the  Smith  Parasite?”.    

With  that goal,  we  can  access  a  small  quantity  of  sociodemographic,  health,  and  behavioral information obtained from the patients. 
We had to analyze and transform the data available as needed and apply different models to answer the defined question in a more accurate way. 

The score of our predictions is the percentage of instances we correctly predict, using the f1 score.
